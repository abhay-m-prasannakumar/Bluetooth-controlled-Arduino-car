It is basically a remote car which works by using a bluetooth module hc05. 
The controller used here is arduino and any other microcontrollers can also be used.
In the file arduino code as well as embedded c code is given.
Simply just assemble the components as shown in the simulation in the report if you are using 8051 microcontroller.
You have to burn 8051 microcontroller with the embedded c program given in report.
If you are using arduino the simulation is given separately 
Upload the arduino code to arduino uno
To control the bluetooth module you can use any hc05 bluetooth app from playstore
